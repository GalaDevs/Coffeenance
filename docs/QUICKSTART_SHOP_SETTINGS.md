## Location Setting

### How to Set:
1. Open app → Tap **Settings** tab (⚙️)
2. Scroll to **Business Information** section
3. Tap **Location**
4. Choose your preferred method:

### Option 1: 🗺️ Pick on Map (Recommended)
**Best for:** Accurate pinpoint location

- Opens interactive map
- Tap anywhere to drop a pin
- Drag pin to adjust
- Shows address automatically
- Tap CONFIRM when ready

**Requires:** Google Maps API key (see setup guide)

### Option 2: 📍 Use Current Location (Fastest)
**Best for:** Setting location while at your shop

- One tap solution
- Uses phone's GPS
- Gets address automatically
- Requires location permission

### Option 3: ✍️ Enter Address (Remote)
**Best for:** Setting up before opening, or from home

- Type your shop's address
- Example: "123 Main Street, Manila, Philippines"
- App tries to find coordinates
- Works without being at the location

### Option 4: 🧭 Open in Maps (View Only)
**Best for:** Verifying saved location

- Opens in Apple Maps or Google Maps
- View/navigate to your shop
- Only works after location is set
